# 2. Lessons Learned

## ✅ What Went Well
- Clean backend architecture (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
- Smooth frontend integration using Axios
- REST API design helped reduce debugging
- Git/GitHub workflow kept progress organized
- Automated tests ensured stable endpoints

## ⚠️ Challenges
### 1. UI/UX took more time than expected
→ Needed more planning for layout and responsiveness.

### 2. Authentication state management in React
→ Required adjustments for token handling and protected pages.

### 3. Time pressure in Stage 4
→ Too much focus on backend early on.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Improve UI/UX design before coding
- Increase frontend test coverage
- Start React earlier in the project timeline
- Add CI workflows sooner (GitHub Actions)
- Use Kanban or daily task tracking

# 3. Team Retrospective (Solo MVP Execution)

Even as a solo project, a retrospective helps evaluate workflow and technical decisions.

## 👍 What Worked Well
- Breaking tasks by sprints
- Structured commit history
- Automated and manual testing
- Clear documentation (Stages 2–4)
- Debugging improved over time

## 👎 What Could Be Better
- Frontend design started late
- Some tasks took longer due to refactoring
- Missing optional features (filters, recommendations)

## 🔧 Improvement Suggestions
- Prioritize UI earlier
- Do more integration testing earlier in the process
- Improve planning estimate accuracy
