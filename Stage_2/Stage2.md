# Stage 2 Report – Project Charter Development

## 1. Project Objectives
**Purpose:**  
BookBridge is a web application that centralizes book resources, helping users discover books and find related online websites in one place. It addresses the challenge of scattered book information, making the process faster and more efficient.

**SMART Objectives:**  
1. Develop a searchable book database with filters for title, author, and category.  
2. Implement a book details page with descriptions and external links.  
3. Enable optional user accounts for saving favorite books.  
4. Document the project clearly for future iterations.

## 2. Stakeholders and Roles
**Stakeholders:**  
- **Primary Users:** Students, general readers  
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** Educators, libraries, book communities  
- **Team Stakeholders:** Development team (frontend, backend, documentation, PM)  

**Team Roles and Responsibilities:**  
| Role                     | Team Member            | Responsibilities |
|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------|

## 3. Scope
**In-Scope (MVP):**  
- Search books by title, author, or category  
- Display book details including author, description, and external links  
- Optional user accounts for saving favorites  
- Simple, responsive frontend design  

**Out-of-Scope (Future Enhancements):**  
- AI-powered book recommendations  
- Integration with eBook providers (Kindle, Google Books)  
- Advanced social features (book clubs, reviews, discussions)

## 4. Risks
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------------|
| Limited time for advanced features | Focus only on MVP; postpone enhancements for later stages |
| Dependency on external book resources/APIs | Use multiple reliable sources and handle missing data gracefully |
| Team learning new technologies | Assign tutorials, knowledge-sharing sessions, and extra learning time |
| Potential UX design issues | Conduct basic user testing and iterate based on feedback |

**Constraints:**  
- Beginner-friendly scope (focus on MVP)  
- Features must align with team skill levels

## 5. High-Level Plan
| Week | Phase / Milestone |
|------|-----------------|
| Week 1 | Stage 1: Idea Development and Team Formation ✅ |
| Week 2 | Stage 2: Project Charter Development ✅ |
| Week 3–4 | Stage 3: Technical Documentation |
| Week 5–8 | Stage 4: MVP Development |
