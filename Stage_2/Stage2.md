  2. Ensure ease of use with a simple UI/UX
  3. Provide reliable and structured book data  

- **Objectives:**  
  - Develop a searchable book database  
  - Implement a book details page with external links  
  - Enable optional user accounts for favorites  
  - Document the project clearly for future iterations

- **Constraints:**
  - Beginner-friendly scope (focus on MVP, avoid overly complex features)  
  - Must align with team skill levels  

---

## 9. Timeline (High-Level)

- All MVP features functional (search, book details, favorites)  
- Clear documentation for setup and usage  
- Team collaboration successful with roles executed effectively
