# 2. About Section

### 📘 Project Inspiration  
The BookBridge project was inspired by my passion for reading and the desire to create a simple, powerful tool for discovering meaningful books. I have always valued reading as a way to learn, improve, and gain new perspectives but finding reliable, organized information can be difficult. BookBridge solves this problem by providing a clean and accessible experience for exploring books.

This project also serves as my **Holberton School Portfolio Project**, developed as part of the full-stack curriculum.
